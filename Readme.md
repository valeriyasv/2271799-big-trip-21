**Bif trip**

A modern service for true travelers.
The service helps intricately plan the travel itinerary, calculate the cost of the journey, and obtain information about attractions.
The minimalist interface prevents distractions, keeping the focus on trip planning.


The project is an application where concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern were actively studied.
The implemented functionality demonstrates the application of these principles to create an efficient and maintainable code structure.
